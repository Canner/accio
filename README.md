## Special Thanks

- [Trino](https://github.com/trinodb/trino)

  Wren's SQL analysis layer is fundamentally based on a modified version of Trino's SQL analysis engine. Trino's clean, readable, and maintainable SQL analysis layer served as a
  significant inspiration, allowing us to focus more on researching and exploring Wren's syntax and models.
- [CrateDB](https://github.com/crate/crate)

  Wren's PostgreSQL Wire Protocol is inspired by CrateDB. CrateDB's implementation of the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol is very clear and easy to maintain, which significantly helped
  us clarify the focus and architecture during the early development stages. This allowed us to concentrate on researching and exploring Wren's syntax and models.
